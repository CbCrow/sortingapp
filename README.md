# sortingapp

This app takes a list of names in SortMe.txt and sorts the names first by length and then by alphabetical order.

The order can be reversed by the flag -r

test.sh can be run with ./test.sh on linux or WSL. This will output if the py file is working in forward and reverse for the default "Sort Me.txt" file
